	    <h4><small>Chief Director, Clinical Trials Centre</small></h4>
	    <p>
	      Prof Lau has 30 years of experience in studying genetics of PID and mapped the genetic loci for XLA and X-SCID in the 1980’s. He has defined novel mutations for PID in Hong Kong and established the Asian PID Network as a referral center for molecular diagnosis of PID for China and nearby Asian countries. In the early years, he collaborated with Professor M Turner and defined the genetics of mannose binding lectin (MBL) deficiency. He found that the MBL genetic polymorphisms in Chinese are associated with systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. He further provided evidence that MBL is of importance in susceptibility to SARS-coronavirus infection and disease progression in hepatitis B virus infection. In the recent years, he focuses on genome-wide association study in SLE and use of next generation sequencing to define mutations in PID.
